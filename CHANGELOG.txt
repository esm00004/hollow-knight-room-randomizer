6/22/22: 
Added mock list to house map names, decided to sort not only by areas, but piece type as well. Next step is to pull 
data from realtime database instead of hardcoded mock list. Then, map images should be added so that sorting can be implimented.
Ended on "Week 4-3".

6/28/22:
Moved the data from mapNames mock list to the realtime database, and deleted the mock list. map names for the sidebar are now
accesed from the realtime database instead of the mock list.
